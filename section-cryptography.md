DIIT is a Java program that can find hidden messages in images.
To run the program, use command in terminal: java -jar diit-1.5.jar     (NOTE: Your version may be different)
Once the program is running, navigate to Decode.
Then you can select the image you want to find the hidden message in.
Select a message file you would like the output to be placed in (I used a duplicate image that I didn't mind being overwritten).
Then, you can simply try decoding the image with the different types of algorithms the program has.
