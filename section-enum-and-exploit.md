# GDB
To open a program/binary with GDB use the command: "gdb <file_name>"

Then to run it in GDB use the command: "run <name_of_function>"         (ex. run main)

The command: "info functions" will return all the functions in the program.

To set a breakpoint at the beginning of a function, use the command: "b main"     (This will put the breakpoint on line 1 of main)

To call a function, run the debugged function (ex. main from the last command), and then run the command: "call <function_name>"
