# Hashcat
 Important flags Flags:
    
    -m                      //Used to specify the type of hash
    -a                      //Used to specify the type of attack
    --potfile-disable       //Once a hash has been cracked, hashcat won't show it again to be concise. This flag disables that so that all hashes being cracked are shown.

Using the hashcat website is very useful for learning how the tool works, and will also give examples of some of the hashes to try and match what you have.
